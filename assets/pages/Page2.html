He was 79.</p>
                                        <p class="second-para">The tough-talking four-star general, long a favourite with Indian TV news channels, came to power through a coup in 1999 that deposed the civilian government headed by prime minister Nawaz Sharif. He clung on to power for almost nine years, helping create the PML-Q party, before he was forced to resign in 2008 to avoid impeachment.</p>

                                        <p class="second-para">Musharraf, who was born in Old Delhi on August 11, 1943 to a career diplomat, rose through the ranks of the Pakistan Army - seeing action during the 1965 war and joining the Special Service Group - before he was appointed army chief by Sharif in October 1998.</p>

                                        <p class="second-para">“The youth of Rajasthan always come ahead of the rest when it comes to the security of the nation,” Modi said via videoconferencing before watching a kabbadi match. The tournament, held every year since 2017, is focussing on kabbadi in this year’s iteration.</p>
                                        <p class="second-para">He emphasised on the need to stay fit not only in sports arenas but in daily life as well.</p>
                                        <p class="second-para">“If you are fit, only then will you be superhit,” Modi said.</p>
                                        <p class="second-para">The sporting tradition of Rajasthan has shaped the mental and physical capabilities of the youth of the region, the Prime Minister said, citing examples of traditional games like dada, sitolia and rumal jhapatta that are organised during Makar Sankranti in January and have been a part of Rajasthan’s tradition for hundreds of years.</p>

                                        <p class="second-para">Sporting activities are finally being viewed from the athlete’s perspective rather than from a political perspective, the Prime Minister said, citing this year’s Union budget to assert that his government has been supportive of the growth of sports in the country.</p>
                                        <p class="second-para">The sports ministry has been allocated a budget of ₹2,500 crore for 2023-24, compared to ₹800-850 crore allocated before 2014. “The sports budget of the country has increased almost three times since 2014,” Modi said. More than ₹1,000 crore have been allocated to the government’s Khelo India campaign alone, which will be spent on the development of sports facilities and resources in the country, he added.</p>
